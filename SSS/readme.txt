There is an executable code called ShamirSecretSharing and an input file named "textfile.txt". 
Upon successful running, the code will ask for total 6*5=30 input indices from 1 to 11(5 for each character) on the console.
After providing them manually the secret message will be printed on the console.
Please update the relative file path of "textfile.txt" in line 18 of the code, or use the string provided in line 16 after commenting out the file reading part.
